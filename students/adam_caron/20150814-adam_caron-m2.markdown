### Areas of Emphasis

What I set out to accomplish this module:
This module I set out to significantly benefit everyone at Turing and its surrounding community, including myself.
 - I aimed to be the best academic student I could be,
 - the strongest project team-member I could be,
 - and by having the most beneficial presence I could have for myself and those around me.

 It was also a priority of mine to focus on individuals within the Turing community who inspire me and who embody traits that I aspire to cultivate.

### Playing a Part

 - Facilitated 1507 Orientation with Lovisa Svalingson
 - Began open source project with Lovisa Svalingson and Adam Jenson: Rails application, called [https://github.com/adamcaron/tidy_up](Tidy Up), that allows Turing students who are assigned posse-cleanup duties to check off cleanup tasks from the list as they progress through the week.

 - Paired every week this module with mentor (Troy Denkinger)
 - Paired with my fellow posse members (1507ers and mentors).

### Feedback From Peers

“He’s been welcoming since day one, and he’s always willing to sit down with me and work on something that I’m stuck on." - Jeff Ruane

"Adam is a committed team member when on projects. As part of our Traffic Spy team, Adam was a constant contributor with a focus on understanding and quality. He contributed strong code and ideas to move the team forward. Adam is both respectful and enthusiastic when pairing which makes the experience better. I look forward to working  with Adam again in the future." - Mike Dorrance

"Approaches everything with a positive attitude and really cares about doing things the right way" - anonymous peer feedback, end of Mod 1

Mid Module Assessment for Module 2 (July 29th, 2015):
"Adam is a strong Rails developer (or will be in 6 weeks at this rate). His process is great and his algorythmic thinking was spot on. During the assessment, Adam allowed the test to drive his workflow. He made assumptions but then validated those assumptions, learning along the way. With repetition, the speed at which he moves through the development process will increase. " - Josh Mejia
